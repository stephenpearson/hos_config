# In these two tasks we pull the ring files from both the builder node and
# the backup node. Hence, we only need one server to be up to get the latest
# version of the rings. If both are down, we continue to use the rings we
# already have (since deploy_dir is unchanged).
# If this is first play after this node is reimaged *and* both builder and
# backup are down, this play will fail when it attempts to copy files
# to /etc/swift.
